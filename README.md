## :star: :black_medium_small_square: Extra :black_medium_small_square: :star:
All in all, this was a great experience, where we touched upon important aspects of programming. Some of our members tried using Linux(WSL) for the first time, which was hella of experience, nuklear was an adventure too. We had ups and downs, but managed to cope with the situation in short time, thanks to our new team leader.
